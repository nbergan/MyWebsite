    I am a hard working military veteran with leadership and communication skills. I just finished working as a Software Engineering Intern at Optum (a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group) during the summer of 2017. I am also a highly creative Junior Software Engineering student at Arizona State University who has a passion for learning.
